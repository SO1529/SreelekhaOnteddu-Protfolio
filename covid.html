								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>
				
									In today's data-driven world, HR analytics plays a crucial role in understanding workforce dynamics and making informed decisions. By analyzing various HR metrics, organizations can identify trends, optimize training programs, and enhance overall employee performance. Let's delve into three insightful graphs that shed light on the interplay between training, department performance, and employee demographics.</p>
								<h2>Graph -1 </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/c-1.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>This line chart highlights the distribution of training sessions across different departments. The y-axis represents the number of trainings, while the x-axis lists various departments.

									Analytics and Procurement departments show a moderate number of trainings, with each having over 3,000 sessions.
									<p>The code provided loads data into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file stored at
                                        the URL ,The essential statistics of the 'Age' column are then printed using Pandas
                                        DataFrame's describe() method.</p>
                                        The distribution of the 'Age' column can be seen using a histogram produced with
                                        Matplotlib. Using the 'bins' argument of the 'plt.hist()' function, the 'Age' values
                                        have been divided into 20 bins. The x-axis label is "Age," while the y-axis label is
                                        "Frequency." Finally, using the 'plt.show()' method, the histogram is presented. </p>
									<h2>Graph -2 </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/c-2.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>The code slices DataFrame df to get only the first 50 rows, groups the data by
                                    state, calculates the sum of the population column for each state, and creates a
                                    bar chart using Matplotlib with the x-axis representing the states and the y-axis
                                    representing the population.The chart title is set to 'Population by State (First 50
                                    rows)', the x-axis and y-axis labels are set to 'State' and 'Population', and the chart
                                    is displayed using the plt.show() function 
                                    </p>
									<h2>Graph -3 </h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/c-3.png" alt="" /></span>
	
									<p>The code creates a new DataFrame 'date_data' that includes only
                                        the'submission_date' and 'tot_cases' columns from the original DataFrame 'df'.
                                        The data is grouped by'submission_date' and the 'tot_cases' column is summed
                                        up using the groupby() function. An interactive line chart is created using the
                                        plotly library with the'submission_date' column as the x-axis and the 'tot_cases'
                                        column as the y-axis. The chart title is set using the 'title' variable and the chart
                                        layout is customized using the 'update_layout()' function. Finally, the chart is
                                        displayed using 'fig.show()' to visualize the total cases by date in an interactive
                                        line chart. </p>
